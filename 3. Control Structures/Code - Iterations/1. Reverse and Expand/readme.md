# Practice program: Reverse and Expand

## Description

Oliver and his friend are playing a number game. If Oliver says a 4-digit number, his friend should reverse the number and expand the number.

If the number is not a 4-digit number, then print '<<number>> is an invalid number'.

Please don't use System.exit(0) to terminate the program.

Hi, I'm "Friendly Hendy" and I can help you write the solution for this description. 

You are provided with a UserInterface class with the main method. 
Create a new Scanner object called "sc" that reads input from the standard input stream (System.in).
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

Declare an integer variable called "reversed" with an initial value of 0.
int reversed=0;

Print the message "Enter the number" using System.out.println() method. 
System.out.println("Enter the number");

Use the nextInt() method of the Scanner object to read an integer value from the user and assign it to the variable "no".
int no=sc.nextInt();

Get the length of the entered integer and assign it to an integer variable called "lengthOfInt".
int lengthOfInt = String.valueOf(no).length();

Check if the length of the entered number is 4 digits.
if(lengthOfInt==4){

If the condition is true, start a while loop that continues until the value of "no" is not 0.
while(no != 0) {

Within the while loop, find the last digit of the number by taking the remainder of the number divided by 10 and assign it to a variable called "digit".
int digit = no % 10;

Concatenate the "digit" to the "reversed" variable by multiplying it by 10 and add "digit" to it.
reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;

Remove the last digit from the "no" variable by dividing it by 10 and close the while loop.
no /= 10;

  }

Print the message "Reversed number is " followed by the value of "reversed" using System.out.println() method.
System.out.println("Reversed number is "+reversed);

Convert the reversed number to a string and split the number into digits by using the split method.
String[] str = Integer.toString(reversed).split("");

Create an empty string called "result".
String result = "";

Start a for loop that continues until the value of i is less than the length of the string array.
for(int i = 0; i < str.length; i++){

Within the for loop, check if the value of the element at position i of the string array is greater than 0.
 if(Integer.valueOf(str[i]) > 0){

Ifthe condition is true, concatenate the element at position i of the string array to the "result" string.
result += str[i];

Start a nested for loop that continues until the value of j is less than the length of the string array minus 1.
for(int j = i; j < str.length - 1; j++){

Within the nested for loop, concatenate '0' to the "result" string and close the nested for loop.
result += '0';

}

Concatenate '+' and ' ' to the "result" string.
result += " + ";

End the if condition inside the for loop and the for loop
}

}

Use the substring method to remove the last three characters of the "result" string, which are '+' and ' '.
result = result.substring(0, result.length() - 3);

Use the replaceAll method to remove any whitespaces from the "result" string.
result = result.replaceAll("\\s+", "");  

Print the "result" string using System.out.println() method.
System.out.println(result);

Close the if statement that checks the length of the entered number
}

If the length of the entered number is not 4 digits, print the message "is an invalid number", using System.out.println() method.
else{      

  System.out.println(no+" is an invalid number");

 }


Sample Input/Output 1:

Enter the number

456

456 is an invalid number



Sample Input/Output 2

Enter the number

5864

Reversed number is 4685

4000+600+80+5



Sample Input/Output 3

Enter the number

3400

Reversed number is 43

40+3
