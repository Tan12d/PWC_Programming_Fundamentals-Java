# Practice program: Area of the shapes

## Description

The fourth standard teacher teaches the area of Basic Shapes to the students. The teacher shows certain shapes, the student is asked to identify the shapes based on the number of sides and calculate the area. Write a java program to find the shape and calculate the area. 

If the number of sides is 0, it is a circle. Get the radius and calculate the area using the formula area of circle = 3.14 * radius * radius.

If the number of sides is 3, it is a triangle. Get the base and height and calculate the area using the formula area of triangle = (base * height)/2.

If the number of sides is 4, get the length and breadth. If the length and breadth are equal, it is a square. Calculate the area using the formula area of square = length * length. If the length and breadth are different, it is a rectangle. Calculate the area using the formula area of rectangle= length * breadth.

If any other value is entered for the number of sides, print "Invalid side".


Note:

Area should have only 2 decimal places.
