# Practice program: BMI Calculator

## Description

Star Fitness Club wants to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for all its customers. Customers may enter their height and weight. Each customer should know their body mass index and weight loss or gain goals to be fit and healthy. Help them to achieve this with the help of a Java program. 

The formula for calculating BMI is weight/((height/100) *(height/100)).

Display the bmi with respect to 2 decimal points.

If bmi is greater than or equal to 25, print "You are overweight" and then print the number of kilograms to be reduced to become fit as "Reduce <<kgs>>kg to be fit".

If bmi is less than 25 and greater than or equal to 18.5, print "You are fit and healthy".

If bmi is less than 18.5, print "You are underweight" and then print the number of kilograms to be gained to become fit as "Gain <<kgs>>kg to be fit".
