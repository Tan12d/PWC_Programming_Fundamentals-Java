# Swap two numbers

## Description

Thara is attending a math lecture, and her professor asks students to swap two numbers using a bitwise operator. The professor finds it difficult to check the logic of 50 students. So, he decided to write a Java program to get two numbers, first and second, from the user and swap the numbers. He is not good at programming. Help them by developing an application using your Java skills.

Note:

Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.
Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.
Adhere to the code template, if provided.
Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program.
