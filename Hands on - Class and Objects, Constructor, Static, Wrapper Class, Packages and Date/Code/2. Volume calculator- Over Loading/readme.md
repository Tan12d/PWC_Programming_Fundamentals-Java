Example

Length = 3

Breadth = 2

Height = 1

Formula

Volume of the Cuboid = length*breadth*height

Volume of the Cuboid = 3*2*1= 6.00.

 

In the UserInterface class, write the main method to test the application.

 Note:

The output format should be in two decimal places. Use "System.out.printf("%.2f", percentage);" for 2 digits after the decimal points.
In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.
Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.
Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.
Adhere to the code template, if provided.
Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program.
